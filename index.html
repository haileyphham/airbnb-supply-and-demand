    <h1>Airbnb Supply and Demand Analysis</h1>
    <p>An analysis of the supply and demand in Airbnb rental listings in Boston, 
        along with the impacts occupancy taxes on the short-term rental market enacted on July 1, 2019.</p>
    <p>The Massachusetts state legislature enacted a room occupancy excise tax on short-term rentals of 31 days or less. 
        The tax applies to hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts, lodging houses, and other short-term rentals including Airbnb rentals. 
        The study begins by processing Airbnb data, focusing on entire homes and apartments rented on weekends. 
        Using this filtered dataset, I constructed demand and supply curves by binning prices and calculating quantities demanded and supplied at different price points.</p>

    <p>The demand curve shows the relationship between the price of Airbnb rentals and the quantity demanded. The scatter plot represents the prices at which rentals were booked and the corresponding number of bookings at those prices. However, this is not the true demand curve as it doesn't account for the total demand at each price point.</p>

    <p>The supply curve shows the relationship between the price of Airbnb rentals and the quantity supplied by hosts. It indicates the number of properties available for booking at various price levels, but doesn't reflect the total amount that would be supplied at those prices.</p>

    <p>This chart combines both the supply and demand curves to visualize the equilibrium price and quantity. The equilibrium is where the two curves intersect, representing the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.</p>

    <div class="caption">
    <p>This chart illustrates the effect of the 14.95% occupancy tax on the demand curve. The tax shifts the demand curve leftward, reducing the quantity demanded at each price. It also shows how the post-tax equilibrium results in a lower quantity demanded and a higher price for consumers.</p>
